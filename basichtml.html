<p>Paragraph.  The &#60;body&#62; tag is the visible page content.  Headings and paragraphs display as block elements by default.  Block elements are stacked rectangular boxes.  Each block element begins on a new line.  Most browsers add an empty line before and after paragraphs.  Browsers remove extra spaces and extra lines.</p>
<br>br tag is line break  It starts a new line without starting a new paragraph.

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com">Link to YouTube external resource on the web called a hyperlink</a>
<br><a href="anotherwebpage.html">Link to another page in the same directory called an anchor.  Relative URL another file in same directory.</a>
<br><a href="anotherwebpage.html" target="_blank">target="_blank" opens link in new browser.  My desktop using Chrome opens new tab.</a>
<br>target="_self" opens in the same frame or same browser window which is default.  target="_parent" opens in the parent frameset.  "target=_top" opens in the full body of the window.  target="display" opens a new window with the name called display; however, if you target the display window from every link on the page, each linked document will open in the same second window. Unfortunately, if that second window stays hidden behind the user's current window, it may look as though the link simply didn't work.
<br><a name="alabel">The name anchor is used inside an HTML document.  Here is a named anchor syntax</a>
<br><a name="#alabel">The link syntax to the named anchor.  The # defines a link to the named anchor.</a>

<br><a href="#samepagelink">Link somewhere else on page.  Go to a name="samepagelink"</a>

<br><a href="mailto:prefixemail@emailserver.com?subject=Default%20Subject%20Title">Link email addresses to generate an email message using the default email application.  Use %20 to ensure spaces between words.</a>

<br><a href="https://externalwebpage.html"><img border="5" src="roselink.jpg" align="middle" alt="red rose" width="150" height="200"></a>border=5 text align center.  align="middle" or "top" or "bottom" which is default

<br>Relative URL points to another file within the same directory. When linking to a file in the same directory, you need to provide only the name of the file (its filename).  If the files arenâ€™t in the same directory, then give the browser directions by including the pathname in the URL; for example, &#60;a href="recipes/salmon.html"&#62;Garlic Salmon&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href="recipes/pasta/couscous.html"&#62;Couscous&#60;/a&#62;.  Link to a higher directory use the Unix pathname convention ../ which is telling the browser to back up one directory level up.  &#60;a href="../index.html"&#62;[Back to home page]&#60;/a&#62;.  Use ../../ to go up two directories.
<br>Tip:  Add a trailing forward slash to subfolder references. href="http://www.w3schools.com/html" generates two HTTP requests to the server because the server adds a foward slash to the address and creates a new request like this href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/".

<p><img src="Dungeon Roll Level Tracker.png" align="right" width="130" height="100">Dungeon Roll Level Tracker.png reduced by 1000 pixels width and 1000 pixels height for good approximation right align image.  width and height should never be used to resize an image.  A paragraph with an image. The align attribute of the image is set to "right". The image floats to the right of this text.  align="right" or align="left".  Float image.  The width and height attributes allow the page to render properly and more efficiently before the image is downloaded. Without them, the page  renders and re-renders when each image is loaded.  The bottom edge of an image aligns with the baseline of text by default</p>

<p>The figure element identifies content that illustrates or supports some point in the text.  A figure may contain an image, a video, a code snippet, text, or a table.  Although you can simply add an image to a page, wrapping it in figure tags makes its purpose explicitly clear semantically.  It also works as a hook for applying special styles to figures but not to other images on the page.</p>

<blockquote>He has a right to criticize, who has a heart to help. --Abraham Lincoln</blockquote>
<p>The browser insert line breaks and margins for a blockquote element.  Here are three consecutive blockquote elements:</p>
<blockquote>Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you; When you think everything's okay and everything's going right; And life has a funny way of helping you out when; You think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up; In your face --Ironic, Alanis Morissette</blockquote>
<blockquote>When you come to a fork in the road, take it. --Yogi Berra</blockquote>
<blockquote>Well, I mean. I don't know, I mean. Winning has a price. And leadership has a price. So I pulled people along when they didn't want to be pulled. I challenged people when they didn't want to be challenged. And I earned that right because my teammates who came after me didn't endure all the things that I endured. Once you joined the team, you lived at a certain standard that I played the game. And I wasn't going to take any less. Now if that means I had to go in there and get in your ass a little bit, then I did that. You ask all my teammates. The one thing about Michael Jordan was he never asked me to do something that he didn't fucking do. When people see this they are going say, 'Well he wasn't really a nice guy. He may have been a tyrant.' Well, that's you. Because you never won anything. I wanted to win, but I wanted them to win to be a part of that as well. Look, I don't have to do this. I am only doing it because it is who I am. That's how I played the game. That was my mentality. If you don't want to play that way, don't play that way. . . . Break. *Jordan requests a break* --Michael Jordan, The Last Dance</blockquote>
