<p>Paragraph.  The &#60;body&#62; tag is the visible page content.  Headings and paragraphs display as block elements by default.  Block elements are stacked rectangular boxes.  Each block element begins on a new line.  Most browsers add an empty line before and after paragraphs.  Browsers remove extra spaces and extra lines.</p>

<p>The figure element identifies content that illustrates or supports some point in the text.  A figure may contain an image, a video, a code snippet, text, or a table.  Although you can simply add an image to a page, wrapping it in figure tags makes its purpose explicitly clear semantically.  It also works as a hook for applying special styles to figures but not to other images on the page.</p>

<blockquote>He has a right to criticize, who has a heart to help. --Abraham Lincoln</blockquote>

<blockquote>Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you; When you think everything's okay and everything's going right; And life has a funny way of helping you out when; You think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up; In your face --Ironic, Alanis Morissette</blockquote>
<blockquote>When you come to a fork in the road, take it. --Yogi Berra</blockquote>
<blockquote>Well, I mean. I don't know, I mean. Winning has a price. And leadership has a price. So I pulled people along when they didn't want to be pulled. I challenged people when they didn't want to be challenged. And I earned that right because my teammates who came after me didn't endure all the things that I endured. Once you joined the team, you lived at a certain standard that I played the game. And I wasn't going to take any less. Now if that means I had to go in there and get in your ass a little bit, then I did that. You ask all my teammates. The one thing about Michael Jordan was he never asked me to do something that he didn't fucking do. When people see this they are going say, 'Well he wasn't really a nice guy. He may have been a tyrant.' Well, that's you. Because you never won anything. I wanted to win, but I wanted them to win to be a part of that as well. Look, I don't have to do this. I am only doing it because it is who I am. That's how I played the game. That was my mentality. If you don't want to play that way, don't play that way. . . . Break. *Jordan requests a break* --Michael Jordan, The Last Dance</blockquote>
